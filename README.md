# About

This is (currently) a demo and evaluation of Docusaurus (v2) for FoundriesFactory documentation purposes.
Documentation here may be incomplete, outdated, or otherwise not fit for consumption.
See our [current docs repo](https://github.com/foundriesio/docs) if you are interested in our docs source.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Implementation Goals

The items below represent what we are evaluating on, and what needs to be demonstrated.
A separate document will present the findings.

[ ] Scalability; Can it grow with increasing contributors and information and remain manageable?
     Conversely, can it be managed and remain simple enough for a team of one?

[ ] Flexibility

    [ ] able to meet changing needs

    [ ] reduce effort through reuse

    [ ] Single source

[ ] Can be coupled with partner documentation

    [ ] security...oauth

    [ ] ease of cloning and modification

[ ] Minimal prerequisites for contribution

    [ ] familiar markup language or plain-text

    [ ] Readable prior to rendering

    [ ] Easy to render and check locally prior to pull request

[ ] Good Findability

    [ ] organized content

    [ ] metrics/reports

    [ ] quick and responsive

    [ ] filtered/ordered

    [ ] optimized for search engines

Support for:

[ ] Importing older documentation versions

[ ] PDF export

[ ] Versioning

[ ] Documenting APIs

[ ] Permalinks

[ ] Minification

[ ] SEO tools

[ ] calculating and displaying read time

[ ] Stable and Supported! We need something that is tried and tested, and will likely be around for awhile

[ ] Open Source

## Usage

### Installation

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

2. Clone this repo

3. Enter the directory and start:

```shell
cd ff-docusarus
npm run start
```

### Local Development

When you run `npm run start`, a local server starts and opens up a browser window to the site (localhost:3000).
When you make changes, they will generally be reflected live.

To see how the site will look when deployed however, you must build it first, generating the html for the
static site.

Configuration is done in `docusaurus.config.js`. See comments in file for details.

#### Build

TODO: Will be writing a script to manage this, as well as deployment.

``` bash
    npm run build
```

To easily view generated html,

``` bash
    npm run serve
```


### Tips, Conventions, and How-Tos

* the sidebar is autogenerated, though a custom one can be used. Pages are organized alphabetically,
  but order can be specified by adding "sidebar_position: " to the
  [page metadata](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated#autogenerated-sidebar-metadata)


### Deployment

TODO
