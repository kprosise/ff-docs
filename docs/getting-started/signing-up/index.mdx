# Getting Started

import version from "@site/static/versions.json"

<span> Yocto Version: {version.yocto}</span>

## Signing Up

To begin using FoundriesFactory®, start with [creating an account](https://app.foundries.io/signup) with us.

## Creating Your Factory

[FoundriesFactory](./reference-manual/factory) is the start of your
embedded OS, tailored specifically for your product.
When you create a Factory, we immediately bootstrap the CI build process. This generates
an unmodified [Linux microPlatform](./reference-manual/linux) OS Image, which
is from this point onward, **owned by you**.

When your account is created, it is not associated with any factories.
Create one by clicking `Create Factory`.

## Selecting Your Platform

Choose a hardware platform from the dropdown menu in the **Create
Factory** wizard and continue. Click `Create Factory`once your details are entered.

:::warning

Once a Factory is created, the chosen platform/machine and Factory name
cannot be changed. Create a new Factory or [contact
support](https://foundriesio.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)
if a mistake is made.

:::

The [Linux MicroPlatform](./reference-manual/linux) supports a wide range of
platforms out of the box. This includes [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)
images for [ARM](https://www.arm.com/) and [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/)
architectures.

:::tip

Your chosen platform determines the value for the `machines:` key for
your builds.

## Watching Your Build

Once you have created your Factory, the initial artifacts from the
Foundries.io™ Linux® microPlatform (LmP) will be generated. This is the
base to build your product. You can monitor the progress in the
`Targets` tab of your Factory.
Additionally, you will receive an email once the Factory initial setup
is complete.

<figcaption>FoundriesFactory Targets</figcaption>
</figure>

Targets are a reference to a platform image and Docker applications.
When developers push code, FoundriesFactory produces a new target.
Registered devices then update and install Targets.

:::note

If you would like to learn more, we wrote a
[blog](https://foundries.io/insights/blog/whats-a-target/) about what
Targets are and why we made them the way they are.

:::

The `Targets` tab of the Factory will
become more useful as you begin to build your application and produce
new Targets for the Factory to build.
