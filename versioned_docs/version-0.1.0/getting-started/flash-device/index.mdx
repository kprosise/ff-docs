# Flashing Your Device

:::note

The initial FoundriesFactory® set up and build is finished very quick.
Follow its status with steps listed in [Watching Your Build](./getting-started/signing-up/#watching-your-build).

:::

## Prerequisites and Pre-Work

- A [supported board](./reference-manual/linux-supported) which is either:
  - Capable of booting from eMMC, **supported by default if available**
  - **Or** capable of booting from a suitable [microSD Card](https://elinux.org/RPi_SD_cards)
- Wired or WiFi network with internet access.
  - Ethernet cable (if choosing Wired)
  - Console access to your hardware via UART serial (if choosing WiFi)

## Downloading the LmP System Image

After a successful build, FoundriesFactory produces build artifacts which can be downloaded from the `Targets` tab of your Factory.

1. Navigate to the `Targets`section of your Factory.

2. Click the Target with the `prebuilt-target` `Trigger`.
   ![pre-built](/img/flash-device/pre-built.png)

3. Expand the `Targets` tab clicking on it.
   This shows a link to the Factory image artifact.
   Download the Factory image for your machine, e.g: `lmp-base-console-image-<machine_name>.wic.gz`:
   ![artifacts](/img/flash-device/artifacts.png)

:::note

Most platforms require more than the `lmp-factory-image-<machine_name>.wic.gz` artifact for flashing.
The required artifacts are board specific and listed in respective pages under.
Targets publish all needed files for each platform under `Runs`.

:::

## Flashing the Image

The flashing procedure is board specific and we cover separate steps in
ref-boards. Please refer to this section
for specifics on flashing your system image using the vendor provided
tools. See ref-qemu for booting Qemu
images.

:::note

LmP enforces eMMC boot whenever possible as this is the path to enable
all security features it provides. So for platforms with available eMMC,
such as the NXP® i.MX EVKs, booting from eMMC rather than SD is highly
recommended and enabled by default.

:::

## Booting and Connecting to the Network

After flashing and booting the board with the respective steps for your
hardware, follow these steps to connect to the network.

:::note

By default, the `username` and `password` to log in your device after
boot are `fio`/`fio`. We recommend changing them once you are in
development.

:::

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Ethernet (Recommended)" default>
    Ethernet works out of the box if a DHCP server is available on the local network.
    Connect an Ethernet cable to the board.
    Your board will connect to the network via Ethernet soon after booting.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Wifi">
    LmP uses `nmcli` and `NetworkManager` to manage network connectivity.
    If you are starting without any network connectivity that would give you
    shell access to your device (like SSH), you will need to **connect via UART serial** before setting up a WiFi connection.
    You may need to refer to your hardware vendor's documentation on UART serial access.
    We cover the steps to access UART serial for some platforms in `ref-boards`.
    Once you have gained shell access to the device, log in with `fio`/`fio`
    username and password. After logged, you can add a new WiFi SSID by
    using `nmcli`:

```bash
sudo nmcli device wifi connect NETWORK_SSID password NETWORK_PASSWORD
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Logging in via SSH

To login via SSH, run:

```bash
ssh fio@<machine-name>.local
```

Where `fio` is the username and `<machine-name>` is the hostname of your
device. The default password is `fio`.

By default, your device hostname is set to a unique string that specify
the platform chosen during Factory creation (`machine`). Check
`ref-linux-supported` for a list of
supported platform and their `machine` values.

::: tip

Here are some examples of default hostnames:

| `raspberrypi4-64.local`
| `intel-corei7-64.local`
| `imx8mm-lpddr4-evk.local`
:::

::: note

For this to work, your PC needs to support
[zeroconf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking).
The hostname must be unclaimed.

If this does not work, see
`Troubleshooting
below for advice.

#### Troubleshooting

If the above methods to SSH into your board do not work, there are
additional things to try.

1. Get the IP address of your device:

    - Temporarily enable and connect to the UART serial (detailed steps for some platforms can be found in `ref-board`
      and determine available IP addresses with:
    - Ethernet:

        ```bash
        ip addr show eth0 scope global
        ```

    - WiFi:

        ```bash
        ip addr show wlan0 scope global
        ```

    - **Or** list the connected devices and their local IP addresses on your network router's administrative interface.

2. Connect to the device by IP address:

    ```bash
    ssh fio@<ip-address>
    ```
